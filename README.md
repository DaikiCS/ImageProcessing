# Project Name: 
Image Proccessing

# Tools:
1. Python
2. Keras
3. VS Code

# About:
This is an image-processing python algorithm to detect certain flowers. 
The categoreis to distict are Daisy, Dendelion, Sunflower, and Tulip.

# Instruction: 
The data set to be used is too big to upload here. Please visit the link to download the data set: https://www.kaggle.com/alxmamaev/flowers-recognition/data

1. How to compile: No need to compile
2. How to execute: python AI_project.py
3. Expected output: Percantage of accuracy of recognition for the flowers in console
4. Known issues: The program runs well and distinguishes flowers on example data set. However,
When trying on the validation data set, it is not as accurate as the example data set. This might have
something to do with our model. cv2 module is not working in VS code even though it is installed. 

# What I learned:
I learned about machine learning in Keras and data segmentation.
